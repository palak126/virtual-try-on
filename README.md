# ðŸ‘— AI-Powered Virtual Try-On System

This project showcases a virtual try-on system that lets users upload a person image and a clothing item image to generate a realistic try-on output â€” all powered by deep learning.

---

## ðŸ“Œ Features

- Upload person & garment images via a web interface
- Warps the clothing item to match body pose
- Outputs realistic blended images using GMM & TOM models
- Clean React-based frontend with live preview
- Feedback form embedded for user input

---

## ðŸ§  How It Works

The system consists of the following stages:

1. **Pose Estimation** â€“ Using OpenPose to extract body keypoints
2. **Cloth Segmentation** â€“ Using U2Net & ResNet101 to extract cloth masks
3. **GMM (Geometric Matching Module)** â€“ Warps the cloth to fit the pose
4. **TOM (Try-On Module)** â€“ Synthesizes the final try-on image with realistic blending

## ðŸ§¾ Dataset

We used the **DeepFashion2** dataset, which contains:

- ðŸ“¦ ~491,000 person images
- ðŸ‘• 801,000 clothing items in 13 categories
- ðŸ§· Key Annotations:
  - Bounding boxes
  - Pose landmarks
  - Segmentation masks
  - Attributes like occlusion, style, and view

We split the dataset as:
- Training: 391K
- Validation: 34K
- Testing: 67K

---

## ðŸ§¼ Preprocessing Pipeline

- Image standardization and normalization (256Ã—256 or 256Ã—192)
- Cropped images using bounding boxes
- Segmentation masks cleaned or generated (MPV dataset used a parser)
- Pose extraction via OpenPose
- JSON annotation conversion and filtering
